## Overview

Yuki is a high-performance e-commerce application built with a modern tech stack centered around Next.js and Turborepo. The platform delivers a seamless shopping experience with lightning-fast page loads, responsive design, and a intuitive user interface.

## Key Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Leveraged Turborepo for efficient code sharing and build optimization across multiple packages
- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety from database to UI components
- **tRPC Integration**: Type-safe API layer connecting frontend and backend systems
- **Prisma ORM**: Robust database operations with migration support and type generation
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS implementation ensuring perfect display across all devices
- **Authentication**: Secure user management with role-based access control
- **Shopping Experience**: Intuitive product discovery, cart management, and checkout flow
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive tools for product and order management

## Technical Implementation

The application is structured as a monorepo using Turborepo, which enables efficient sharing of code between packages while maintaining clear separation of concerns. The frontend is built with Next.js, utilizing its powerful routing and rendering capabilities, while the backend leverages tRPC to provide type-safe API endpoints.

Data persistence is handled through Prisma, providing a type-safe interface to the database with seamless migration capabilities. The UI is crafted using TailwindCSS, enabling rapid development of responsive and visually appealing interfaces.

## Challenges & Solutions

One significant challenge was optimizing the application for both performance and developer experience. By implementing strategic code splitting and utilizing Turborepo's intelligent caching, we achieved substantial improvements in build times and runtime performance without compromising code maintainability.

## Outcome

Yuki demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined to create e-commerce experiences that are both user-friendly and developer-friendly. The application showcases the power of TypeScript's type safety across the entire stack, from database queries to UI components.
