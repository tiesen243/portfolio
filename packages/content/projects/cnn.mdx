## Introduction

**@tiesen243/cnn** is a full-stack interactive application that brings handwritten digit recognition to your browser. By leveraging a custom-built convolutional neural network (CNN) powered by PyTorch, a Python Flask web backend, and a Vue.js frontend, this project allows users to draw digits on a canvas and instantly get predictions from a trained neural network.

## How It Works

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch

At the heart of the project is a CNN defined in `src/cnn.py`, built using PyTorch. The model consists of:

- Multiple convolutional layers and ReLU activations
- Max pooling for spatial downsampling
- Flattening and fully connected layers
- Softmax output for digit classification (0–9)

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark for digit recognition, with support for performance tracking via loss and accuracy metrics.

### 2. Training Pipeline

The training process is handled in a Jupyter Notebook (`src/train.ipynb`), which:

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST data
- Defines the CNN architecture
- Trains the model and evaluates accuracy
- Saves the trained model weights for later inference

### 3. Flask API Backend

A simple Flask application (`src/app.py`) serves as the backend:

- Loads the trained CNN model
- Exposes a `/predict` endpoint that accepts POST requests with an image
- Preprocesses the image (resizing, normalization, tensor conversion)
- Returns the predicted digit as a JSON response

### 4. Interactive Vue.js Frontend

The frontend is a single-page app built with Vue 3 (`src/static/main.js` + `src/templates/index.html`):

- Users can draw digits on an HTML `<canvas>`
- The app provides "Predict" and "Clear" buttons
- Upon prediction, the canvas image is sent to the Flask backend, and the predicted digit is displayed in real time
- Uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design

## Key Features

- **End-to-End ML Demo:** From model definition and training to real-time inference in the browser.
- **Live Drawing Canvas:** Engaging user experience for digit input.
- **RESTful API:** Easily extensible for other ML tasks.
- **Clean, Modular Code:** Separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and model logic.
- **GPU Support:** PyTorch model runs on CUDA if available for fast inference.

## Example Usage

1. Draw a digit (0–9) on the canvas.
2. Click "Predict" to send your drawing to the backend.
3. View the prediction instantly, powered by a deep neural network.

## Why This Project Is Cool

- **Educational Value:** Great example for learning about neural networks, model serving, and frontend-backend integration.
- **Full Stack:** Combines Python, JavaScript, machine learning, and modern web development.
- **Open Source:** Easily adaptable for your own image classification projects.

## Conclusion

@tiesen243/cnn is a fantastic showcase of bringing AI models into interactive web apps. Whether you're learning about machine learning, web development, or looking for a template to deploy your own models, this project has you covered.
