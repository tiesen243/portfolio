## Introduction

**Egg Community** is a feature-rich, modern social platform created for the egg antifan community. Built with cutting-edge web technologies like Next.js, ElysiaJS, Prisma, and TailwindCSS, it delivers a smooth, beautiful, and functional user experience for sharing posts, images, and discussions.

## Key Features

- **Social Posting:** Users can create, edit, and delete rich-text posts, optionally with images.
- **Comments & Likes:** Engage with others via comments and like buttons on each post.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile with avatar, name, and their own posts.
- **Image Uploads:** Uses Cloudinary for fast, reliable, and scalable media storage.
- **Authentication:** Session-based authentication with user context for secure, personalized experiences.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with TailwindCSS for a seamless experience on all devices.
- **SEO & Metadata:** Custom SEO configuration for better search engine visibility and shareability.
- **Dark Mode:** Theming support out of the box.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** ElysiaJS API, Prisma ORM for database interactions
- **Authentication:** Session management with React context and server-side session checks
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary integration for image uploads and management
- **SEO:** Dynamic meta tags via a central `seo` utility
- **Database:** Prisma ORM with environment-based logging for local development and production

## Architectural Highlights

- **Modular Components:** UI and logic are split into reusable React components, including post menus, comment menus, and session providers.
- **API Communication:** Uses `@elysiajs/eden` and a typed API client for seamless, type-safe client-server interaction.
- **Session Context:** The `SessionProvider` React context shares user and session information throughout the app.
- **Cloudinary File Handling:** Server-side utilities to upload and delete images, keeping media management simple and robust.
- **Loading States:** Custom loading pages and animated spinners for smooth navigation.

## Example: Post Page Workflow

When a user navigates to a post:

1. **Server Auth:** User authentication is checked server-side for personalized experience.
2. **Fetch Post:** The post data, including author details, content, images, and comments, is fetched from the API.
3. **Render:** The post is rendered with author info, content, image (if any), and interactive like/comment features.
4. **Interactions:** Users can like, comment, and (if they are the author) edit or delete their post.

## Why Egg Community Stands Out

- **Performance:** Built on Next.js app directory with server components for fast loading.
- **Modern Stack:** Combines the best of React, TypeScript, and serverless APIs.
- **Developer Experience:** Clean, well-organized code with full TypeScript support and environment-based configuration for easy scaling.

## Conclusion

Egg Community illustrates how to build a next-generation social network with today's web technology stack. Whether you're part of the egg antifan community or just looking for a reference for your own social app, this project provides a strong foundation, modern patterns, and extensibility.
