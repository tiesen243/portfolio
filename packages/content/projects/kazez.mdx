### Example: Anime Data Fetching

Kazez uses React Query to fetch and cache anime data. Users can filter by genre, season, status, and more. Example snippet:

```typescript
export const useAnimes = ({ ...options }: UseAnimesOptions) =>
  useQuery({
    queryKey: [...],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const url = // build API URL with filters
      const res = await fetch(url)
      return res.json()
    },
  })
```

### Example: SEO Utility

SEO is managed centrally:

```typescript
export const seo = (params: Prams): Metadata => ({
  title: params.title ? `${params.title} | Kazez` : 'Kazez',
  description: params.description ?? 'Watch anime online for free...',
  // ... more meta tags
})
```

### Authentication

Kazez uses Lucia for authentication, managing sessions securely with cookies and supporting server-side session validation for protected routes.

## User Experience

- **Anime Listings:** Pagination and filters allow users to discover new anime by genre, season, and popularity.
