## Introduction

**create-yuki-stack** is a modern CLI tool for rapidly scaffolding production-ready, fully-typed full-stack TypeScript applications.

## Features

- **Multiple Frontend Options**: Choose between Next.js, React Router, or TanStack Start for your frontend.
- **API Layer Choices**: Select tRPC or oRPC for end-to-end type safety.
- **Database Flexibility**: Prisma, Drizzle, or Mongoose integration (or none).
- **Authentication**: Built-in support for NextAuth.js, Better Auth, or basic auth flows.
- **UI Components**: Optionally integrate with shadcn/ui for beautiful, customizable UIs.
- **Turborepo Monorepo**: Optimized monorepo structure for scalable codebases and efficient DX.
- **Shared Packages**: Organize common code and types into shared packages.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Optional GitHub Actions, email extras, and more.

## Quick Start

To scaffold a new full-stack app, just run:

```sh
npx create-yuki-stack@latest
```

Or use your favorite package manager:

```sh
npm create yuki-stack
yarn create yuki-stack
pnpm create yuki-stack
bun create yuki-stack
```

The CLI walks you through interactive prompts for your stack, or you can use flags for non-interactive setup.
