## Brand Essence

Tiesen stands for innovation, reliability, and excellence. Our brand guidelines help ensure every touchpoint reflects these values, building trust and recognition.

## Logo

The Tiesen logo is the cornerstone of our identity. Always use the official version for maximum impact and recognition.

### Logo Usage

- Use clear space around the logo to maintain visibility.
- Do not alter, stretch, or recolor the logo.
- Use the logo on neutral backgrounds for best results.

## Logotype

Our logotype offers a clean, text-based alternative for situations where subtlety or space constraints apply.
