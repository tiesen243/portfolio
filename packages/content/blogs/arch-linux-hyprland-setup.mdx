## Installation

### Requirements

- A usb drive with at least 8GB of storage
- A ISO image of Arch Linux [Download](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- A computer with a 64-bit processor
- A stable internet connection

### Installation steps

**First**, you need to download the Arch Linux ISO image from the Arch Linux website. You can download the ISO image from the Arch Linux website by clicking on the download link on the Arch Linux website.

**Second**, use `Ventoy` to burn the ISO image to the USB drive. You can download Ventoy from this [website](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) . Once you have downloaded Ventoy, you can craete bootable USB, then copy the ISO file to this.

**Third**, plug the USB drive into the computer that you want to install Arch Linux on. Then, you need to boot the computer from the USB drive. You can do this by restarting the computer and pressing the boot menu key when the computer starts up. The boot menu key is usually F12, but it can vary depending on the computer. Once you have booted the computer from the USB drive, you need to select the Arch Linux installation option from the boot menu.

**Finally**, started to install Arch Linux on your computer. You can follow the Arch Linux installation guide to install Arch Linux on your computer.

```bash
# Increase the font size
setfont ter-120n
```

Check the internet connection.

```bash
ping google.com
```

If the internet connection is not working, you can use the following command to connect to the internet.

```bash
iwctl

# List the available device
device list

# Scan the available network
station device_name scan
station device_name get-networks

# Connect to the network
station device_name connect SSID
# Enter the password

# Check the connection
station device_name show

# Exit the iwctl and check the connection
exit
ping google.com

# if the connection is working, you can continue the next step
```

Set up drive partitions to install Arch Linux.

```bash
# Show the available disk
lsblk

# Choose the drive has at least 50GB of storage
# Use cfdisk to create a new partition table on the drive
cfdisk /dev/[drive_name]
```

Create the partitions on the drive.

- Move the cursor to the free space and press `Enter`
- Select the `New` option and press `Enter`
- Set the size of the partition is `1G` and press `Enter`
- Select `type` to `EFI System` and press `Enter`
- Go to the free space again and select the `New` option and press `Enter`
- Set the size of the partition is at least `40GB` and press `Enter`

  :::info

  This partition is used to home directory

  You can set the size according to your needs. If you have more storage, you can set a larger size for this partition.

  :::

- Select `write` and press `Enter` to write the changes to the disk then `quit` to exit the cfdisk

```bash
# Format the partitions
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/[drive_name] # EFI partition 1G
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[drive_name] # Home partition >= 40G

# Mount the partitions to the system
mount --mkdir /dev/[drive_name] /mnt/archinstall # Home partition (>= 40G)
mount --mkdir /dev/[drive_name] /mnt/archinstall/boot # EFI partition (1G)
```

Run `archinstall` script to start the installation. In archinstall script, you can choose the following options:

- `Disk configuration`:
  - Choose `Pre-mounted configuration` to use the partitions that you have created
  - Enter the directory: `/mnt/archinstall`
- `Bootloader`: Choose `GRUB` as the bootloader
- `Hostname`: Enter the hostname for the computer
- `Root password`: Enter the root password
- `User`: Create your user account and remember to set user as `superuser`
- `Profile`:
  - Choose `Desktop` as the profile and select `Hyprland` as the desktop environment
  - Choose `Graphics driver` and select GPU driver for your computer. In my case, I choose `Nvidia` driver
  - `Greeter`: Choose `SDDM` as the greeter or something you like
- `Additional packages`:
  - Choose `Yes` to install additional packages
  - Enter the package name: `grub` `efibootmgr` `os-prober` `neovim` `pipewire-pulse` or `pulseaudio`
  - Press enter to verify the package name
- `Network configuration`: Choose `Use NetworkManager` to manage the network connection
- `Timezone`: Choose the timezone for your location.
- Finally, choose `Install` to start the installation process

:::warning

If you encounter a "Failed to install packages to new root" error when running `archinstall`, you may need to update the Arch Linux keyring before proceeding:

```bash
pacman -S archlinux-keyring
```

:::

After that, configure the system to boot into Arch Linux.

```bash
bootctl remove

# Mount the EFI partitions of Windows 11
lsblk # Check the EFI partition
mkdir /mnt/windows
mount /dev/[drive_name] /mnt/windows

# Grub installation
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Then, config `grub` boot menu

```bash
nvim /etc/default/grub
```

Uncomment the following line

```bash title="/etc/default/grub"
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false
```

Update the grub resolution by find and update the following line

```bash title="/etc/default/grub"
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080x32
```

Optionally, you can set GRUB to remember your last boot selection:

```bash title="/etc/default/grub"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
```

Finally, reboot the computer and select the Arch Linux in the boot menu to start the system.

```bash
exit
reboot
```

After reboot, open the terminal by press `Win + Q`, and start to set up dual boot with Windows 11.

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Now, you can reboot the computer and can see the Windows 11 in the boot menu.
